Advanced Programming Techniques Assignment 01

This program works best using the terminal file redirection. If you wish to use the terminal, I suggest pasting the entire 
environment in and pressing ctrl + d (you may have to press it twice - not sure if this is a fault of my code or my machine).

All tests can be found in the "tests" file. The whitespace in expout files is intended because I think it looks nicer in the terminal :)

This program does have a Makefile, so you can compile with the "make" command. This defaults the program name to "assign1". 

This program always assumes that there is an environment input - no exceptions are included.
Also, as per the assignment specifications, the environment must always be completely surrounded by walls; and there must always be a start 
and goal position included. 

Thanks :)
